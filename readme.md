# Sleep Disorder Prediction Analysis

![Sleep Deprivation](Sleep%20Deprivation.jpg)

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this data science initiative is to analyze the interplay between lifestyle habits, physiological metrics, and sleep health. By examining critical variables such as age, BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, and cardiovascular indicators, we aim to predict the likelihood and specific type of sleep disorders an individual may face.

Sleep disorders, including Insomnia and Sleep Apnea, pose significant risks to long-term health and well-being. By identifying at-risk individuals early, we can facilitate targeted interventions and personalized treatments to enhance sleep quality and overall health outcomes.

## Dataset Description

This analysis utilizes the **"Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset"**, a comprehensive collection of data from 400 individuals across 13 key variables. The dataset offers a holistic view of sleep patterns and daily habits, categorized as follows:

*   **Comprehensive Sleep Metrics**: Detailed insights into sleep duration and self-reported sleep quality.
*   **Lifestyle Factors**: Fundamental lifestyle indicators including physical activity levels, stress assessments, and BMI categories.
*   **Cardiovascular Health**: Vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate, providing crucial context for cardiovascular well-being.
*   **Sleep Disorder Classification**: The dataset categorizes individuals into three distinct groups:
    *   *None*: No specific sleep disorder identified.
    *   *Insomnia*: Persistent difficulty falling or staying asleep.
    *   *Sleep Apnea*: Disrupted sleep patterns characterized by pauses in breathing.
